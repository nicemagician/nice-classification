electric glue guns,"There can be confusion with certain electrically heated apparatus in other classes but, unlike Class 11 apparatus, electrically heated apparatus in other classes use heat in order to perform a task rather than having heating as their primary function. For instance, electric glue guns are in Cl. 7 because their purpose is to apply glue (even though heat is used to melt the glue in the gun), whereas glue-heating appliances are in Class 11 because their purpose is to melt the glue, and keep it viscous using heat, so it can then be applied to a surface using a separate tool.",7,en
